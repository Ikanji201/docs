## INTRODUCTION

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a decentralized marketplace on the Celo blockchain using Solidity programming language. Specifically, we will create a School Resources Marketplace where students can buy and sell educational resources such as books, lecture notes, and other educational materials. We will use the ERC-20 token standard to facilitate the exchange of value and the IPFS protocol to store the resources. This tutorial assumes basic knowledge of Solidity and blockchain technology. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional decentralized marketplace that can be used by students to exchange educational resources in a secure and decentralized manner.


## REQUIREMENT

To take this tutorial, you will need:

- Access to a code editor or text editor such as Remix.

- A reliable internet browser and internet connection.

## PREREQUISITE 

- Basic knowledge of Javascript.

- Understand how Blockchain works.

- Have a basic knowledge of solidity.

Let's now start the process of writing our smart contract.
