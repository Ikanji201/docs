## INTRODUCTION

This project is a simple smart contract for selling various hair products. The contract allows users to add, view, and purchase virtual hair products. It utilizes the ERC20 token standard and OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library for secure calculations. The contract includes a struct for storing hair product details and a mapping to keep track of added hair products. Users can also replace the image of a hair product they own. The contract can be deployed on the Celo blockchain using tools such as Remix or Truffle.
